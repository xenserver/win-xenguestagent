List of maintainers and how to submit changes
=============================================

This is an early public release of the XenServer Windows XenGuestAgent.

At the moment we are working hard on improving this early release, to make
it easier to build and install and test on your own systems.  As such things 
are in a state of flux, and we may well find it difficult to take submissions.

We hope things will have improved by January 2014

If you do wish to submit code, we recommend reaching out to the maintainers
first, who will attempt to steer you in the right direction.

We also request you follow these guidelines:

1.  All submissions must be made under the terms of the "Developer's Certificate
    of Origin" (DC) and should include a Signed-off-by: line.

2.  All Submissions should use Unix line endings for consitency with the rest of
    the XenServer project

3.  Each patch should include a descriptive commit comment that helps understand
    why the patch is necessary and why it works. This will be used both for
    initial review and for new people to understand how the code works later

4.  Make sure you have the right to submit any changes you make. If you do 
    changes at work you may find your employer owns the patches instead of 
    you.
